# UFC_ML_Prediction

Repository for MISK DSI Capstone Project


### Topic Choice

I have been a fan of WWE  for as long as I remember. Until I knew it was fake :(. Just like many of you, choosing the capstone topic was very easy (not) for me, but overall I was glad about the result because I challenged myself a lot in this project. And to me

Challenge = Growth

### Goal/Question

1- Can a model predict the winner of an MMA fight based on certain features?

2- Which of those feature seems to have the most effect on those model?

## Solution Steps

1. Choose what I want to predict exactly. (Decision round scores, fight general outcome, or fight win/lose outcome) (5%)
2. Collect the data that fits my goal/question (30%)
3. Clean that data to fit my modeling process + Feature engineering (30%) 
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (5%)
5. Model selection, training, evaluation, and parameter tuning (%20)
6. Presenting the project (%10) 

### Assumptions:

- That future stats won't affect past events
- That all the target column will be evenly split
- That the model will process fighters with more experience just like it will do with fighters with less experience
- That I had the most important features I need to make a good prediction

### Models Selected

1. Logristic Regression

Chose because it's very simple, and fundemental in ML. So, it can be a baseline

2. Random Forest

It's one of the most used models in sport's analytics, and also one of the best performers in binary classification

3. Support Vector Machine

I wanted to chose a new model, so I can challange myself and tryout models that could be better performing

## Main Takeaways

- MMA prediction is not that simple, because of the complexity of the sport, but extreme winners and extreme losers exist in every sport
- Coding != Data science
- Machine learning is not just plugging numbers
- You are never really finish a data science project
